## Red Eye Detection from camera flash Using CNN and Data Augmentation

At night, when a picture is captured by using flashlight, eyeball turned into read and it makes
the subject animated. To address this problem and make the image natural, it is imperative to
detect the red eye which is done by implementing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).Furthermore,
Data Augmentation has been applied to regenerate more images in order to prevent overfitting the 
data. The process of artificially expanding the amount of data by producing new data points
from existing data is known as data augmentation. This includes making minimal changes
to data or utilizing machine learning models to generate new data points in the original data's
latent space to amplify the dataset. the accuracy of this model is 97.92%
